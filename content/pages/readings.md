How should we talk about topics in science and engineering so that people can best understand their importance and relevance?

How can we effectively talk about our interests or work in science in informal settings?

Students will share brief chats about a topic in science for group discussion and quick feedback.

We will watch/listen to, and discuss select AV clips of scientists talking about science and discussion of strengths and weaknesses.

Workshop: Talking Science
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}
 
{{< tdclose >}}{{< tdopen >}}

In small groups or pairs, we will practice speaking about the topic in science, technology, or engineering you have prepared.

Take notes and provide feedback to your counterparts. Attempt to deliver your own version of an informal explanation of another student's topic.

As a class, we will ask students to report on others' topics.

How can science be best communicated to influence the course of policy?

We will discuss the critical elements and contexts for communicating science to policymakers, including providing recommendations, testimony, and policy analysis.

How can we communicate complex topics in science without "dumbing down" the material?

In a world where knowledge is increasingly specialized, how can we best communicate the nuances of ideas to people in other disciplines or fields?

We will discuss useful tools for communicating complex subjects, including the use of metaphors, narrative, visual elements, and providing context.

We will talk about what elements worked and did not work in the readings/videos and what tactics might be used in your final projects.

What challenges face science communicators when they come to deal with subjects on which scientists themselves disagree?

In this class, we will discuss some of the tough problems that communicators have faced in areas such as evolutionary biology, stem cell research, and climate change.

Using a famous controversy about recombinant DNA technology that took place in Cambridge MA in the 1970s, we will explore the many opportunities that controversies also provide for creative science communication.

What are the aims of this news section?

What audience(s) is it aimed at?

What sorts of editorial criteria have been used in selecting and writing the stories carried in this section?

How do you suppose these stories were researched and written?

We will talk about tactics for providing interviews and giving scientific information to the media as a source.

Director of Communications at MIT Nate Nickerson will join us to discuss examples of how he communicates and works with faculty to communicate the scientific research and projects at the Institute.

What role do scientists and science play in the courtroom?

What considerations are important to communicate science to judges and juries to best influence the justice system?

We will discuss ethical and practical considerations of communicating science in the courtroom.

We will also watch excerpts from a re-enactment of scientific testimony on evolution during the Dover Trial and discuss what elements were effective.
